## 为什么要成为一个数据高速公路排序器？

Later we will switch the DataHighway Testnet from using PoA to instead use Nominated Proof of Stake (NPos) consensus, where validators **stake DHX tokens** to validate transactions and blocks to secure the blockchain. Validator nodes that receive the Block Reward may optionally share a proportion of it with other accounts that staked tokens to nominated them.

When the DataHighway Testnet becomes a Parachain on the Polkadot network, then the validators will become known instead as <a href="https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/maintain-collator" target="_blank" class="pretty-link pretty-link-colored">Collators</a>.

## Why become a DataHighway Nominator?

Nominators may receive a proportion of the Block Reward that Collator Nodes they nominate may receive. The Mining Speed Boost multiplier that eligible Token Miners or Hardware Miners may claim may be used to receive a higher Block Reward. Nominating is less involved than becoming a Collator.
