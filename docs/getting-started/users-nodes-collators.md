## Why become a DataHighway Collator?

The DataHighway Testnet uses Nominated Proof of Stake (NPos) consensus, where Collators **stake DHX tokens** to have transactions and blocks to secure the blockchain validated in the Polkadot relaychain. Collator nodes that receive the Block Reward may optionally share a proportion of it with other accounts that staked tokens to nominated them.
