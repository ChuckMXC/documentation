# Data Highway Documentation

Welcome to the Data Highway developer documentation. We're just getting started, so our documentation is going to look somewhat empty. We'll start out with modifying the https://docusaurus.io/ initial template to create something that looks more like our Data Highway branding.

## Contributing
The repository is structured as a docusaurus project with the markdown files organized in the /docs directory. The images and other assets are in the /docs/assets/ directory.

Refer to [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
